### üèõÔ∏è Architecture

Dishcover is built using modern architectural principles to ensure it is robust, testable, and scalable.

*   **Clean Architecture:** The project follows a strict separation of concerns into **Presentation**, **Domain**, and **Data** layers. This isolates business logic from UI and implementation details, making the codebase flexible and easy to maintain.
*   **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** The presentation layer uses the MVVM pattern to separate UI state and logic from the UI rendering, integrating perfectly with Jetpack Compose.
*   **Reactive & Asynchronous:** The app is fully reactive, using **Kotlin Flow** and **Coroutines** to manage asynchronous operations, data streams, and UI updates, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
*   **Dependency Injection:** We use **Hilt** to manage dependencies, which simplifies development, promotes loose coupling, and makes testing easier.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Dependencies

*   **100% Kotlin:** The entire application is written in Kotlin.
*   **UI:** [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for a modern, declarative UI.
*   **Backend & Cloud Services:** [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
    *   **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication for user management.
    *   **Database:** Firestore for real-time, cloud-based NoSQL data storage.
    *   **Storage:** Cloud Storage for Firebase for images and media.
    *   **Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.
*   **Local Persistence:** [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for robust offline database storage.
*   **Asynchronous Programming:** [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) & [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html).
*   **Dependency Injection:** [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) for DI in Android.
*   **Networking:** (Implicitly through Firebase SDK)
*   **Code Quality:** Detekt and Android Lint.
